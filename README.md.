# Robotic Arm Package Sorter

This Python script categorizes packages into `STANDARD`, `SPECIAL`, and `REJECTED` based on their volume and mass.

## Problem Description:
- A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or any dimension is greater than or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is **heavy** if its mass is greater than or equal to 20 kg.

### Dispatch Rules:
- `STANDARD`: Packages that are neither bulky nor heavy.
- `SPECIAL`: Packages that are either bulky or heavy.
- `REJECTED`: Packages that are both bulky and heavy.
